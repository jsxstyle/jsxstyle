'jsxstyle-webpack-plugin': minor

Added inline CSS import support. You can enable the option by setting `inlineImports` to either `single` or `multiple` in your `jsxstyle-webpack-plugin` settings.

Assuming a file has styles that `jsxstyle-webpack-plugin` can extract:

- When `inlineImports` is set to `single`, one import will be prepended to the processed file. This import will contain all the extracted CSS rules from the file.
- When `inlineImports` is set to `multiple`, one import _per CSS rule_ will be prepended to the file. The `multiple` option may very well cause performance issues in large applications. Iâ€™m not sure how well webpack does with potentially thousands of extra modules. It will result in incredibly accurate CSS rule deduping however, since each CSS rule is now a module that webpack can hoist and dedupe.
