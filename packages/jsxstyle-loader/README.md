# jsxstyle-loader

`jsxstyle-loader` is a webpack loader that extracts [**static style props**](#what-are-static-style-props) from jsxstyle components into a separate CSS file.

Don‚Äôt know what jsxstyle is? Check out the [jsxstyle README][] for more information.

## Getting Started

1.  Add a new rule object for `jsxstyle-loader` to your webpack config.

2.  Add a loader that handles `.css` files to your webpack config, because `jsxstyle-loader` adds a `.css` `require` to each component that uses jsxstyle.

3.  Add `jsxstyle-loader`‚Äôs companion plugin to the `plugins` section of your webpack config.

When you‚Äôre done, the relevant parts of your webpack config should look like this:

```js
const JsxstyleLoaderPlugin = require('jsxstyle-loader/plugin');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [new JsxstyleLoaderPlugin()],
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      // ...
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'babel-loader',
            options: {}
          },
          {
            loader: 'jsxstyle-loader'
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: 'your-cool-css-loader',
      },
      // ...
    ],
  },
};
```

## Loader Options

### `styleGroups`

By default, `jsxstyle-loader` will extract all static style props on a jsxstyle component into one class. This can lead to CSS classes that contain a lot of common style declarations. A good CSS minifier should help with this, but if you want a bit more control over how styles are grouped into CSS classes, you can provide an _array_ of CSS style objects. When `jsxstyle-loader` encounters a component that contains all styles in a style object, those styles will be extracted into a separate class name.

For example, with the following loader config:

```js
{
  loader: 'jsxstyle-loader',
  options: {
    styleGroups: [
      {
        display: 'block',
      },
      {
        marginLeft: 15,
        marginRight: 15,
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

...and a jsxstyle component that looks like this:

```jsx
import { Block } from 'jsxstyle';

<Block backgroundColor="blue" marginLeft={15} marginRight={15} padding={20} />;
```

...the styles on this component will be extracted into three separate classes:

```css
._x0 {
  display: block;
}
._x1 {
  margin-left: 15px;
  margin-right: 15px;
}
._x2 {
  background-color: blue;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

Without the `styleGroups` parameter, all five style props would be extracted into one class.

### `namedStyleGroups`

The `namedStyleGroups` config option is just like the `styleGroups` config option, with one key difference: it is expected to be an _object_ of CSS style objects, not an array. The key of the CSS style object will be used as the class name if all props and values are present on a jsxstyle component.

### `whitelistedModules`

The `whitelistedModules` config option allows you to add modules to the evaluation context. For example, with the following loader config, any prop on a jsxstyle component that references a value from `./LayoutConstants.js` will be assumed to be evaluatable:

```js
{
  loader: 'jsxstyle-loader',
  options: {
    whitelistedModules: [
      require.resolve('./LayoutConstants'),
    ],
  },
}
```

### `parserPlugins`

`jsxstyle-loader` uses `babylon` to parse javascript into an AST. By default, `jsxstyle-loader` is preconfigured with most of `babylon`‚Äôs plugins enabled, but if you need to enable additional plugins, you can specify an array of plugins with the `parserPlugins` option.

You can see a list of all available plugins in [the `babylon` README][babylon plugins].

### `classNameFormat`

Out of the box, `jsxstyle-loader` will use a _non-deterministic_ class naming scheme. Because webpack‚Äôs module iteration order is not guaranteed, class names will differ slightly between builds of the same code. If you need class names to remain the same each time the same code is bundled, set the `classNameFormat` option to `hash` in your loader config. Class names will be generated using a content-based hash.

### `liteMode`

```jsx
// look ma, no jsxstyle import
<block color="red">This text will be red</block>
```

Instead of importing components from `jsxstyle` or `jsxstyle/preact`, don‚Äôt import _anything_ and just use the dash-case version of the component name as if it‚Äôs a valid DOM element. When `jsxstyle-loader` encounters one of these dash-case elements, it‚Äôll treat it like the PascalCased equivalent component imported from `jsxstyle` or `jsxstyle/preact`.

To enable this feature, set `liteMode` in your loader options to either `'react'` or `'preact'`.

## FAQs

### Can I use `jsxstyle-loader` with Flow?

Yes! Flow parsing is automatically enabled for any non-Typescript files.

### Can I use `jsxstyle-loader` with Typescript?

Yes! Take a look at [the TypeScript example][ts example] and [issue #82][issue 82] for some context. You‚Äôll need to make a few configuration changes:

1.  Set `jsx` to `preserve` in the `compilerOptions` section of your `tsconfig.json` file.
2.  Ensure `jsxstyle-loader` runs _after_ `ts-loader`. Webpack loaders run from bottom to top, to `jsxstyle-loader` needs to be placed _before_ `ts-loader` in your webpack config.
3.  Add a loader that transpiles JSX, since `ts-loader` is now set to preserve JSX.

### It‚Äôs not working üò©

1.  Make sure the loader object `test` regex matches JS files that use jsxstyle.
2.  `jsxstyle-loader` relies on JSX still being around, so make sure it runs _before_ `babel-loader` does its thing.
3.  `jsxstyle-loader` only supports destructured `require`/`import` syntax:

    ```jsx
    // Cool!
    import { Block } from 'jsxstyle';
    <Block />;

    // Neat!
    const { Block } = require('jsxstyle');
    <Block />;

    // Nope :(
    const Block = require('jsxstyle').Block;
    <Block />;
    ```

### What are ‚Äústatic style props‚Äù?

Simply put, static style props are props whose values can be evaluated at build time. By default, this consists of any literal type (`string`, `number`, `null`) as well as any variables provided to the evaluation context. The evaluation context is derived from the prop‚Äôs current scope.

For example, the `fontSize` prop in the following component will be marked as evaluatable and will be extracted as `42`:

```jsx
import { Block } from 'jsxstyle';

const bestNumber = 42;
<Block fontSize={bestNumber}>hello</Block>;
```

Any modules marked as whitelisted with the [`whitelistedModules`](#whitelistedmodules) config option will also be added to the evaluation context.

If the value of a style prop is a ternary and both sides can be evaluated, the prop will be extracted and the ternary condition will be moved to the `className`.

If the value of a prop is a simple logical expression with the `&&` operator, it will be converted to a ternary with a null alternate.

### Inline styles‚Ä¶ _are bad_.

See [the jsxstyle FAQs][jsxstyle faqs].

### Does it work with hot reloading?

It sure does, but using it in development will only cause confusion, since what you will see in the developer tools is the _transformed_ JS. `jsxstyle-loader` is a _production_ optimisation.

### Any caveats?

One big one: CSS class names are not de-duplicated across components. Any CSS minifier that combines identical class names will handle deduplication.
